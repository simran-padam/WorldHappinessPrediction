# WorldHappinessPrediction

The goal of this project is to predict World Happiness using United Nation's World Happiness Rankings country level data. What makes the citizens of one country more happy than the citizens of other countries? Do variables measuring perceptions of corruption, GDP, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, or social support associate with a country's happiness ranking?
